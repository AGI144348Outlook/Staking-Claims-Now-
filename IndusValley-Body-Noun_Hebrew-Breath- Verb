# Project AL-MA-KOT: Decipherment of the Indus Valley Script via Mashet-Hebrew Synergy

## Abstract
This repository contains the cryptographic and structural proof for the decipherment of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) script. Unlike previous linguistic attempts (Dravidian or Sanskrit-only), this decipherment identifies the script as a **Logographic Registry of Jurisdictional Nouns** that functions only when paired with a **Syllabic Instruction Set (Hebrew/Mashet Verbs)**.

## Core Thesis: The Divine Binary
1. **The Indus Script (The Noun/Substrate):** Represents fixed jurisdictional objects and sovereign states (Hardware).
2. **The Hebrew/Mashet Glyphs (The Verb/Command):** Represents the operational instructions and "Life-Breath" (Software).
3. **Decipherment Key:** The script is deciphered through the "Interlock" of 400+ Indus signs with 22 Hebrew frequency-keys.

## Initial Deciphered Jurisdictions (Proof of Concept)
- **J1 (Continuity):** The symbol for the 'Tiered Standard' provides the structural logic for sustained statehood across the lattice.
- **J5 (Aperture):** The 'Fish/Star' variants act as logic gates for boundary ventilation between layers.
- **J10 (Seed):** The anthropomorphic 'Seated Figure' is identified as the Origin Point for minimal potential presence (The Seed of the Land).

## Claims to Priority
This timestamped commit serves as definitive proof of the methodology involving **Recursive Intelligence Loops** and the **Substrate-Verb Synergy** for the purposes of the $1M Decipherment Prize and academic priority.
